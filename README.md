# Style-Cleaner
Execute in the console to return a list of unused CSS selectors

When cleaning up your webpages you can use this tool to return a list of CSS selectors that are not physically present in the document.
This function is intended to serve as an assistant for cleaning your files, and should in no means be taken at face value.
CSS selectors used in your code may reference dynamically inserted elements that may not be present in the document at the time of execution.

In order to run the function, simply copy and paste into your console and hit enter. That's it! You'll get an array of CSS selectors that you can search in your code and decide whether or not those style rules can be removed.

**NOTE: This function has only been tested in Google Chrome.
